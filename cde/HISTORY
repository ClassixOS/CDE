# 2.2.2 07/27/2014

A lot of fixes and improvements in this release.  CDE can be built on
more modern Linuxes and BSDs.  An initial stab at illimios support is
also present.

Here is the shortlog:

Eugene Doudine (7):
      Fixes the bug #17 dtsession can't validate passwords longer than 8 characters when the session is locked
      Fixed bug #27 dtfile space handling bug
      Fixed bug #32 dtfile table formatting bug with non-latin filenames
      Fixes the off-by-one bug in RegisterInGrid(), which caused dtfile's desktop icons on the right edge of the screen (if desktop width is not a multiple of icon with) to be registered on the next workspace or (in the case of the last workspace) beyond the desktop_grid array (possibly causing segfaults).
      Fixes several issues with grid registration of the dtwm panel on dtfile startup and on workspace addition:
      Fixes a small bug in grid registration: when an object is placed over another object (can be done manually) and then removed from there, the registration of the covered object is removed as well (that is it's cell is considered empty).
      Fixes the bug, which caused dtterm to show stripes of wrong color between text lines when using fontsets that include fonts of slightly different heights.

# 2.2.0d (beta) 05/30/2013

- We are being bold this time, and promoting CDE to Beta.

- More work on dtinfo.  It now mostly compiles but is not quite ready
  for prime time.  It is not built be default.

- dtksh now builds on linux systems.

- We do not build Motif man pages anymore.

- X11 screensaver extension support now works in dtsession on Linux.

- Some screen locking issues on the BSD's have been fixed.

- /usr/sbin/sendmail is now the default mailer on OpenBSD 

- Basic support for Xinerama has been added to dtlogin and dtsession
  using a new DtXinerama library.

- Resolve many more more compiler warnings


# 2.2.0c (alpha) 10/4/2012

- Many 64b issues have been fixed, related to XtVaGetValues(), missing
  prototypes, erroneous assumptions regarding the size of ints and
  pointers, etc.  Many still lurk in the shadows.

- help files should build now on 64b systems with compiler
  optimization enabled.

- FreeBSD is pretty much fully functional now.  OpenBSD and NetBSD are
  close behind.

- FreeBSD uses a authorized FreeBSD Foundation specific logo on
  dtlogin.

- a few hundred more compiler warnings fixed :)

- more missing prototypes added to XmPrivate.h


# 2.2.0b (alpha) 9/6/2012

- This release incoporates approximately 200 patches from various
  people around the planet.

- initial BSD (OpenBSD, FreeBSD) support.

- wider support for various Linux distributions - Redhat, Arch,
  Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Xubuntu.  See a full list of currently operational
  platforms and their statuses at:

  https://sourceforge.net/p/cdesktopenv/wiki/SupportedPlatforms/

- many fixes to better support 64b systems.  There is still much work
  needed in this regard.

- most modules are operational.  dtinfo is not operational on any
  platform yet.  dtksh is not yet operational on linux systems.

- several thousand compiler warnings have been addressed.
  Unfortunately, there are still several thousand more waiting :(
  Some of this code is *old*.


# 2.2.0a (alpha) 8/6/2012

- This is the initial release of CDE form The Open Group based on
  2.1.30.   

  Minimal changes to get it compiling on some common linux distros,
  primarily 32bit.
