This directory contains older CDE documentation in gzipped postscript
format.  These can be converted to pdf files on linux with a command
like this:

gunzip -c AppBuilder.ps.gz |ps2pdf - /tmp/AppBuilder.pdf

If/When dtinfo is ever made to work, we can get more up to date
documentation from there.  Until then, old docs are better than no
docs...
