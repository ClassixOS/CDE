Hello,

I have written a simple AWK program to convert .vcs files into
XAPIA format files that can then be dragged and dropped on the Calendar
icon of the front panel to insert an appointment in the CDE calendar.

The program has some limitations. For the moment, it ignores ToDo items
and only converts appointment items. Also, it has to convert 
appointments that extend on more than a single day (such as holidays) 
into daily repeats
and to transform "UNTIL=" repetitions into a number of repetition.
This is done by using an average duration of 30.44 days for a month
and 365.25 days for a year instead of using the correct duration for
leap years and for months. So the duration of an appointment can
be sometimes calculated incorrectly.

If you wish to include it with the CDE sources or to post it on the Wiki 
documentation, I agree to release it under MIT license.

Otherwise, there are better programs in Perl by Adam Stein at:

but they require to install some extra Perl libraries.

Best wishes,

Edmond Orignac
