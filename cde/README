The Common Desktop Environment is released under the terms of the LGPL

*************************************
Purpose of this release:

This release of CDE under a new opensource license is numbered
starting at version 2.2.0.

************************************
Downloading this release:

CDE may be downloaded in source form from the Common Desktop
Environment website:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdesktopenv/

Or via git:

git clone --recursive git://git.code.sf.net/p/cdesktopenv/code cdesktopenv-code

The git repository will always be more up to date than the
downloadable tarballs we make available, so if you have problems,
please try the latest version from git master.

As of 2.3.2b, a new ksh93 submodule is used in place of the original
ksh93 source code.  If you have already cloned the repo (without the
--recursive flag) you will need to update the ksh submode with
something like:

cd desktopenv-code
git submodule update --init

************************************
Installing this release:

Complete build and installation instructions can be found on the CDE
wiki:

http://sourceforge.net/p/cdesktopenv/wiki/Home/

Please go there and read the appropriate section(s) for your OS (Linux
or FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD currently).  There are a variety of
dependencies that must be met, as well as specific set up steps
required to build.

Do not expect to just type 'make' and have it actually work without
meeting the prerequisites and following the correct steps as spelled
out on the wiki. :)

There are also a lot of other documents and information there that you
might find useful.

************************************
